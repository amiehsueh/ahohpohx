                            <p> (I'm not quite sure where to ask this, so if this is in the wrong location, I'm sorry) Does anyone have any suggestions on how the crap to get decent cable management when using one of these ( cards? No matter how I re-arrange the freaking cables, I can't seem to get it to look any good, or get any decent airflow because the IDE cables get in the way of everything (even the fancy aerodynamic ones). Client has an external 1TB hard drive that no longer turns on at all. My first thought is; Ok the electronics in the enclosure are bad so lets open it up and see what we can/cant access directly from the hdd's. The problem is, there are 4 hard drives (250GB each) that are IDE connections all in 1 large raid 0 array. How can i recover his data for him?.(the drives all tested good). I can setup a computer to do the Raid 0 through an IDE interface but only with 2 of the drives Yesterday I passed my 901. I used Professor Messer's 901 course notes, Crucial Exams, The Zirosoft 901 app on Android and some Quizlet flashcards to study. The simulation questions I was given were set up a SOHO Router, Build a IDE RAID array and Drag and drop protocols next to their function. I hope this helps. My PC is old (read: dinosaur, IDE drives, AGP video card, single core, etc). and it's not worth it to upgrade it to be honest when I use my macbook pro sometimes. But I'd like to make some of my data redundant. I have 2 identical 320GB IDE drives, and an external 1TB USB 2.0 drive. I would have an OS drive for WinXP, and I'd like to take the 320's and do a software RAID 1 on them.how slow would that be? Would it just be better to get a PCI IDE RAID card instead? Just trying to figure 
All, I'm migrating over to VYOS, a die hard PFSense person at my home. The configuration is seamless and currently I'm running through my USB flash drive, however I have a problem. ​ I have this installed on a whitebox, which PFSENSE was on, on a different hard drive. When attempting to boot after 'install image' installation method was chosen, VYOS will not boot. Grub states it's installed on sda, which is my hard disk, but after install it doesn't see GRUB. Is there something I'm missing?. Hardware: 970A-G43 Plus Motherboard Samsung EVO 250gb SSD EVGAGTX 970 16 GB ram (2x4 and 8) AMD 4350 Quad CPU Recently purchased an SSD after my HDD died, trying to install windows 10 through USB. USB windows install goes fine until it requires a restart to boot off of my SSD, at which point I get one of the following screens: "Reboot and Select proper Boot Device" if I boot the SSD using UEFI+Legacy Mode The EFI Shell if I select Hi there, first time here. Recently did a cpu/mobo/case/ram upgrade. I had two HDDs that were working fine in my last setup, though in my new setup, no hard drive is being detected on any SATA port, tested with the exact same known-good SATA Power SATA data cable that Windows can boot up from on the SSD Have tried : flashing bios to most recent version -a few data and power cable combos, but since the known good ones are known-good and work with the SSD. just mainly ruled I have a box full of parallel ATA drives that I've pulled from old working computers and haven't a clue what to do with them in terms of a good use case. Obviously they're too old to be resold, but I have this notion that maybe a RAID setup would probably work better than a singular drive would, but obviously not be impressively fast. I tried to research if anybody has done this, but there seems to be no topic about it. It would be cool to know if it is at least somewhat of an effective Timestamp: https://imgur.com/a/PLO9fRM I got these with drives in them intending to use them. I never got around to setting up that homelab, so I sold the drives. These things don’t take up much room in the crawl space but they are heavy as fuck and I hate having to keep shuffling them around. They support up to 14x 750GB IDE drives each for a total of 10.5TB per bay. These are FREE but you HAVE to pick them up from my house. I’m not about to lug these bitches around. Come Sunday, they’re. Hi. Have an problem with old build. I had some components and build a PC. I don't change any bios settings because I build it quick and when I install Windows then check BIOS. Only RAID for Old hitachi HDD July 2012 working. At AHCI and IDE shows me a blue screen. Does this make any difference at sata controller? MBO hp ipibl-lb CPU Q9300 GPU HD5850 RAM 3GB but I don't remember what exactly. I have a IDE->SATA card (plugs into IDE slot and you can connect SATA to it ) and also a PCI -> 2 x SATA card (plugs into PCI slot and allows 2 SATA connections). Would connecting HDD's with important data to those cards be as safe compared to normal SATA slots? (i ran out of SATA slots). Hello, I have found a box with these kind of hard disks (they are Maxtor DiamondMax 9 Plus of 80gb) and now I am searching for an adapter to use them with an USB connection, but i am worried about the fact that some of these adapters are prone to problems, like the one "Molex to SATA lose all your data". I have found an adapter on Amazon that seems the best for my situation, this (https://www.amazon.it/UGREEN-Adattatore-Superspeed-Supporta-Alimentazione/dp/B019SW4Z42/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid. 
I built this PC about 4 months ago and haven't really had any problems. I was using it earlier today and stepped away for a bit. When I came back it said "No bootable device is detected. System will enter the BIOS Setup Utility." and kicked me to BIOS. Obviously the first thing I did was check the cables to make sure that they were plugged in. I changed the SATA cable I had been using and made sure that power was getting to my hard drive. When I turn my computer on, the hard drive does get power. I'm trying to hackintosh an older LGA775 machine. The issue is, the hard drive isn't detected in Disk Utility, neither by IDE nor RAID modes. I only have those 2 modes available in the BIOS. The RAID mode shows something about AHCI during boot but it still doesn't detect. I've heard you need some kexts for IDE or RAID modes? Can anyone point me in the right direction? Thanks in advance. Hey all, I'm new to VMWare and was trying to set up a Home vSphere Lab and was wondering if you guys had any ideas on this. When I go to install ESXi, it is not recognizing all of my HDDs. Only 2 of 4. I think I have figured out half of the problem, but I am missing a link. When in my BIOS under Sata Config, it also only recognizes the same 2 drives. Yet, when I go to boot options, it can see them all.(Windows can see them all as well) Best I can figure is it must be detecting the other I posted this 4 days ago, so I believe it is okay for me to post it again. This stuff is really taking up way too much space. So.I've really gone into a cleaning mood and am raiding the stuff I've stashed away in my room in my parent's house. I have a lot of really old computer stuff that I'd rather leave my life so I don't have to deal with it once I go off to graduate school. To be honest, this stuff was in storage packed in anti-static bags and brown paper bags for a few years So, I have a old Gateway PC I acquired years ago from my parents when they got a new PC, and it's been in my room unused for a while. I also have a 2 bay Synology NAS unit, but want to expand and figured I could try to re-purpose this Gateway to run FreeNAS. The Gateway only has 4GB of RAM though and FreeNAS says it needs 8. I can upgrade the RAM to 8 max, per Gateway spec, but it is DDR2 RAM and am wondering if it is worth it to buy the RAM and stick with this board 650 Watt A-power PSU Motherboard: MSI 880GM-35 (FX) 500GB Seagate Hard drive AMD Sempron 145 (Hidden core unlocked) 2 x 2GB Kingston RAM Tried using a Windows 7 64bit installation disc, it can get to the BIOS but as soon as windows starts to load, it gets to the Windows starting screen and freezes instantly (before the logo forms completely) After thousands of google searches and forum discussions this is a list of everything we've done to get it to work. Tried updating the motherboard. So.I've really gone into a cleaning mood and am raiding the stuff I've stashed away in my room in my parent's house. I have a lot of really old computer stuff that I'd rather leave my life so I don't have to deal with it once I go off to graduate school. To be honest, this stuff was in storage packed in anti-static bags and brown paper bags for a few years, so I'm not really quite sure to the status of this stuff's proper functioning, so please keep that in mind! I will state if otherwise!. 
I am running into issues with resurrecting an old gaming PC. I purchased all the parts back in Mary 2012 and had it up and running the way I wanted them with a non-legal copy of Windows 7. I played on the machine for several months. Life and personal issues caused me to shelve the unit for some time. Flash forward to now and I wanted to install my OEM copy of Windows 7 on the machine and get it setup to my liking. I have 1 SSD that I had Win7 installed and upgraded to Win 10. It was setup. </p>
