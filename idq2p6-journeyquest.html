                            <p> I've been rewatching this series, and I think it is the best thing ZOE made. It makes me want to play DND, which is good because I've promised my nephew a campaign. I play more indie one shots these days, so thank you JourneyQuest (https://youtu.be/pVORGr2fDk8) for getting Do you guys know any fantasy with the same feel as the show? The things i'd like to see most: twisting of the rpg/fantasy tropes- i like this the most. Our heroes are somewhat typical, but there is something off in each of them, which makes them beautifully different from their expected role in the fantasy trope. And, the standard fantasy elements are also quite good and so cozy. character relashionships humour Any of those are great alone, as i loved both the humour and the acting/stor. Hey folks, I'm not the creator, just a fan that's been watching their stuff since the original 'The Gamers' came out back in the early 90s. This project has about 30 hours to go, but I figured with 16k members in the sub, that this would be a good place to share. https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/zombieorpheus/journeyquest-35-and-campaign-setting/description (https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/zombieorpheus/journeyquest-35-and-campaign-setting/description).

We (Matt Vancil and Ben Dobyns) set out back in 2000 to make a little film about roleplaying gaming called The Gamers. That turned into enough of a hit that we got together with a group of friends to create Dead Gentlemen Productions. Now we're Dead Gentlemen and Zombie Orpheus and, in addition to Dorkness Rising, Demon Hunters, and JourneyQuest, we are currently producing our newest feature film, The Gamers: Hands of Fate (http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/zombieorpheus/the-gamers-hands-of-f. Check out this week's Weird Things: new space station who dis ( On this week's edition of #Journey Quest (starts around 35:30), the guys enter Diamondtown and encounter the masked leader Commander Cool/Admiral Awesome/Bossman/King Awesome/King Cool and there was speculation we might know who's under the mask. Who do you think 
https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/zombieorpheus/journeyquest-season-3 Hi folks some of you might know this about this series already but if you don't it's a fantastic fan made show about a group of adventurers filmed as live action roleplayeing (LARP) with ever increasing production values and great stories that capture the essence of RPGs. They also make the "Gamers" series which is an RPG gamer group playing there campaign at the tabletop but also switches into larp format. They currently. Season 2 asked for ,000. Now they are asking for 0,000? But, they are producing the same number of episodes. Zombie Orpheus Entertainment is planning a full sized production of Journeyquest! they need to make their goal! If you haven't seen the series before, I recommend watching it, as it's quite funny. Here's a link for the lazy (https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLB600313D4723E21F) They need a pretty hefty sum and only have 6 days left. They say the odds are they can't continue the series if they don't complete their goal, because they're going to be sinking their jobs for this series. Renew JourneyQuest! Click here to sign up! ( The producers of JourneyQuest are looking for 4200 people who would be interested in helping fund their Kickstarter campaign to fund season 3. They need roughly 2000 more people just to say they would be interested and then they will put up the Kickstarter. This is going to be a huge production, with their goal being 0,000 for the costs of production. It should be easy to reach that if we all pitch. </p>
