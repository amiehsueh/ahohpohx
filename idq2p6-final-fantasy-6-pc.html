Well, a busy past few months left me with little time for gaming, and I kind of fell back in terms of progress, but I still managed to squeeze a few titles in over the past few months. amp#x200B; Dear Esther: Landmark Edition (PC): (Completed 2/10/2019) As the trademark "walking sim", I've been interested in this game for awhile, especially with the reception it's had over the years. Dear Esther is more one of an interactive work of art than it is a full fledged Download (https://www.nexusmods.com/finalfantasy9/mods/14) This mod fixes all the sounds and audio compression in Final Fantasy IX (PC). Among the fixes are: Sound Effects: -Every sound effect is physically replaced with their correct, PSX counterpart. -Audio compression -Sets the Audio Sampling Rate to 44100hz and removes the compression on BGM. Enemy Death SFX: -Returns every enemy's death sfxs battle cry as it was in PSX. Some cosmetic fixes such as: -Reflect sfx -Jump and Summon. E no meio dessa história está o uso do Denuvo Anti-Tamper no jogo. --- Denuvo, pra quem não sabe, é um tipo de DRM que tem em alguns jogos e é bem controverso, como quase todo DRM. Além de proteger arquivos de um jogo de serem adulterados, faz autenticação num servidor próprio de tempos em tempos, podendo ser uma vez por semana, ou por mês, e raramente uma única vez.

Hello everyone! I'm here to post an update on my newest Let's Play. Videos go up once a week for this series so they tend to be a bit longer than some of my other LPs. In this video we get captured! A band of bandits lead by Hein ambush us and trap us in a big tree prison. We make our escape and manage to defeat Hein's corrupted form. The battle does get pretty dicey though. Afterwards go back to Cid and he gets us an Airship. Our first action with the new Ship is to journey to the mysterious. While myself and many others are excited for the just announced Steam release of Dissidia NT, it's important to note that we can't just expect that simply releasing the game on Steam and calling it a day is enough to do many favours for this game. Word of subpar PC ports gets around quickly in the PC community, and I have no doubt in my mind that major outlets like Digital Foundry on YouTube will be doing a technical analysis on the port. If the port is subpar, and is costly As per title, Turn-based JRPG like Final Fantasy I-X (XII kinda action turn-based), Pokemon, Dragon Quest, Lost Odyssey, Persona, Cyber Sleuth, Stick of Truth etc. Games where you travel and you encounter/meet enemy then you fight turn-based. Almost played all, now searching for more and I'm addicted to this kind of games (where nowadays developer kind of stop making them, example latest Final Fantasy). For PC or PS4 (but I spend most of my time on PC except for PS4 exclusive games). P/S. pleas. ###Sale Categories amp Highlights Homepage (https://www.greenmangaming.com) Hot Deals (https://www.greenmangaming.com/hot-deals/) Green Man Gaming Staff Picks (https://www.greenmangaming.com/holiday-sale/green-man-gaming-staff-picks/) 2018 Best Sellers (https://www.greenmangaming.com/holiday-sale/2018-best-sellers/ ) Apply voucher code GMG12 in the basket to get the final sale price ###New Titles Added Today Game Total Discount I've wanted a GPD XD+ but I don't fully know what it can play, can it play the Final Fantasy VIII PC Port, and can it emulate
